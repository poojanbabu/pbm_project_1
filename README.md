# pbm_project_1
Practical Biomedical Modeling (PBM) project on noise in a simple biochemical switch.<br />
Main paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22107236

The project contains two python files:
1. input_distribution.py: To generate a Poisson distruibution of the input process. The input process here is a simple birth-death process of input molecules belonging to the category of Immigration-death processes.

2. Simulation.py: Simulation of the effect of noise on the biochemical switch where the transitions of the switch depend on the input molecules generated by th Poisson process.
